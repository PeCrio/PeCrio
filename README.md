### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
I am Precious OSSAI, a Frontend heavy Full stack Software Engineer that loves transforming problems into scalable solutions with design and technology for intuitive human-centered experiences.

I am a music and art lover that enjoys traveling and exploring. Whenever I am not writing code, designing, building, or learning something, I am probably playing video games (usually Call of Duty Mobile (COD) and car racing games), swimming, cycling, playing a game of pool/snooker, catching up with family, friends, and acquaintances or maybe just eating and sleeping. Amongst my arsenal, below are a few of my preferred tools:
- ReactJS + NextJs + Typescript
- VueJs + NuxtJs + Typescript
- Laravel, NodeJs
- ReactNative
- Figma
- AWS

Feel free to go through my website here: https://ossaiprecious.com to learn more and connect.
