### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
I am Precious OSSAI, a Frontend heavy Full stack Software Engineer that loves transforming problems into scalable solutions with design and technology for intuitive human-centered experiences.

I am a music and art lover that enjoys traveling and exploring. Whenever I am not writing code, designing, building, or learning something, I am probably playing video games (usually Call of Duty Mobile (COD) and car racing games), swimming, cycling, playing a game of snooker, catching up with family, friends, and acquaintances or maybe just eating and sleeping. Amongst my arsenal, below are a few of my preferred tools:
- NextJS
- ReactJS
- Figma
- Laravel

Some others include:
- NuxtJS
- VueJS
- NodeJS
- ReactNative, etc.

Some principles/standards/stacks I also work with: TDD, JAMSTACK, ES6+, TypeScript, Atomic Design, MERN, Cypress, PHPUnit, CICD etc.

Hobbies: Snooker, Swimming, Cycling, Music.
